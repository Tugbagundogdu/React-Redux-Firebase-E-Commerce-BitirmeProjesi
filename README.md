# React-Redux-Firebase-E-Commerce-BitirmeProjesi
I developed an E-commerce website as my graduation project. In this project, I utilized Redux Toolkit and Firebase for login, signup, and Google authentication processes. <br>
To give a brief overview, when you click the + button below the products, they are listed in the Cart page. Clicking on the title of a product will redirect you to the ProductDetail page where you can find detailed information about the product. <br>
Scroll down to access the product details and comments. In the Cart page, you can proceed to checkout by clicking the checkout button or continue shopping by adding more items to your cart. In the Shop section, you can filter products according to your preferences or search for specific items by their names. <br>
 After signing up, you will be redirected to the login page, or you can directly access the home page by clicking on the "Sign in with Google" option <br> <br>
You can explore the project [here](https://tugba-gundogdu-firebase.vercel.app/home). <br>
